### Intro

- about Martin
    - visual neuroscience and electrophysiology
    - Laura Busse's lab, work on mouse vision and behaviour, record neurophysiology with optogenetic manipulation
    - Python experience:
        - needed visual stimulus presentation program
        - found VisionEgg, written in Python by a neuroscientist/entomologist, flexibility, features we needed, and it was free!
    - now use Python for:
        - arithmetic, simple calculations instead of a calculator
        - simpler things like renaming a bunch of files/folders in nested hierarchy
        - acquiring video frames from an eye-tracking camera
        - neural spike sorting & data analysis
        - managing a database for storing all our lab data

- quick round of intros: name, field of study, programming background, data analysis wants/needs

- why programming/coding?
    - for those who don't know any programming: how do you analyze your data?
    - probably Excel, which is a mini language
    - programming gives you the flexibility to do just about anything with your data, or any data
        - use lots of small building blocks, combine them in sequences in infinite ways
        - trick is to learn which blocks to use, and when, and how best to combine them
        - can make scientific discoveries, give machines the ability to learn, or fly a helicopter on Mars - can't do that with Excel

- why Python?
    - like Matlab, Python is an "interpreted" language as opposed to a "compiled" language - no extra compilation step as in many other languages, developing code is easier and quicker
    - Python installation is relatively small, on disk and in memory, launches faster than Matlab
    - Python is free, and also open source: code behind Python and all of its libraries can be inspected, modified, improved by anyone - not so with Matlab
        - using Python can make science more open and reproducible:
            - ultimately, science needs open publication, open data, open hardware, and open code
            - LMU open science center: https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/
    - Python is used more outside of science and engineering than within it - huge user base
        - easy to find answers to problems, easy to find existing tools (libraries) that already do what you want to do
        - end result is fewer lines of code that *you* need to write to accomplish something
    - Python has been growing in popularity over many years, now ranked #1 depending on how you measure it
        - https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/
        - https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages
    - fits your brain - Python syntax is intuitive, often reads like English
        - Guido: "programming languages are as much about communicating ideas between developers as they are about telling a computer what to do"
    - batteries included - lots and lots of tools built in, and endless more that can be installed
        - bit like toolboxes in Matlab, but free and open
    - helps make you employable
    - motivation:
        - example: load data, analyze, plot, save
        - `python LFP_analysis_example.py`

- class stuff
    - integrated lecture + in-class exercises
        - lecture: introduce concepts wth live coding, saved to a history.txt file uploaded afterwards
        - exercises: practice the concepts
    - please remember to keep your audio muted when not speaking

#### Outline

1. Python basics
2. Python basics 2
3. collections
4. [numpy](http://numpy.org) 1D arrays
5. numpy data types
6. numpy file operations, plotting with [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)
7. more matplotlib, matrices
8. image analysis
9. data analysis with [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
10. statistics
11. dimension reduction & clustering
12. organizing code, data, results; [version
control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) with
[Git](https://git-scm.com/); work on project

#### Grades

- attendance: 25%, all or nothing
    - can miss up to 3 out of 12 classes, any more and no credit for course
- homework: 25%, 4 homework assignments, short, similar to in-class exercises
    - graded by attempt, not outcome
    - we'll go over solutions the following week
    - programming is a skill, like any other language, need practice listening/speaking/reading/writing
    - struggling and overcoming the struggle is part of the process
- final project: 50%
    - meet list of requirements that are fairly easy to fulfill
    - code needs to run more or less successfully
